## torch.matmul

```
`torch.``matmul`(*input*, *other*, *out=None*) → Tensor
```

Matrix product of two tensors.

The behavior depends on the dimensionality of the tensors as follows:

- If both tensors are 1-dimensional, the dot product (scalar) is returned.
- If both arguments are 2-dimensional, the matrix-matrix product is returned.
- If the first argument is 1-dimensional and the second argument is 2-dimensional, a 1 is prepended to its dimension for the purpose of the matrix multiply. After the matrix multiply, the prepended dimension is removed.
- If the first argument is 2-dimensional and the second argument is 1-dimensional, the matrix-vector product is returned.
- If both arguments are at least 1-dimensional and at least one argument is N-dimensional (where N > 2), then a batched matrix multiply is returned. If the first argument is 1-dimensional, a 1 is prepended to its dimension for the purpose of the batched matrix multiply and removed after. If the second argument is 1-dimensional, a 1 is appended to its dimension for the purpose of the batched matrix multiple and removed after. The non-matrix (i.e. batch) dimensions are [broadcasted](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/broadcasting.html#broadcasting-semantics) (and thus must be broadcastable). For example, if `input` is a (j \times 1 \times n \times m)(*j*×1×*n*×*m*) tensor and `other` is a (k \times m \times p)(*k*×*m*×*p*) tensor, `out` will be an (j \times k \times n \times p)(*j*×*k*×*n*×*p*) tensor.

> note:

- The 1-dimensional dot product version of this function does not support an `out` parameter.

> Parameters

- **input** ([*Tensor*](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor)) – the first tensor to be multiplied
- **other** ([*Tensor*](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor)) – the second tensor to be multiplied
- **out** ([*Tensor*](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor)*,* *optional*) – the output tensor.

> Example

```
>>> # vector x vector
>>> tensor1 = torch.randn(3)
>>> tensor2 = torch.randn(3)
>>> torch.matmul(tensor1, tensor2).size()
torch.Size([])
>>> # matrix x vector
>>> tensor1 = torch.randn(3, 4)
>>> tensor2 = torch.randn(4)
>>> torch.matmul(tensor1, tensor2).size()
torch.Size([3])
>>> # batched matrix x broadcasted vector
>>> tensor1 = torch.randn(10, 3, 4)
>>> tensor2 = torch.randn(4)
>>> torch.matmul(tensor1, tensor2).size()
torch.Size([10, 3])
>>> # batched matrix x batched matrix
>>> tensor1 = torch.randn(10, 3, 4)
>>> tensor2 = torch.randn(10, 4, 5)
>>> torch.matmul(tensor1, tensor2).size()
torch.Size([10, 3, 5])
>>> # batched matrix x broadcasted matrix
>>> tensor1 = torch.randn(10, 3, 4)
>>> tensor2 = torch.randn(4, 5)
>>> torch.matmul(tensor1, tensor2).size()
torch.Size([10, 3, 5])
```

## torch.mm

执行输入矩阵和mat2矩阵的乘法运算，如果输入是一个(n×m)的张量,mat2是(m×p)的张量,将得到一个 (n×p)的张量。

> NOTE

This function does not [broadcast](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/broadcasting.html#broadcasting-semantics). For broadcasting matrix products, see [`torch.matmul()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.matmul.html#torch.matmul).

> Parameters

**input** ([*Tensor*](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor)) – the first matrix to be multiplied**mat2** ([*Tensor*](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor)) – the second matrix to be multiplied**out** ([*Tensor*](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor)*,* *optional*) – the output tensor.

> Example

```
>>> mat1 = torch.randn(2, 3)
>>> mat2 = torch.randn(3, 3)
>>> torch.mm(mat1, mat2)
tensor([[ 0.4851,  0.5037, -0.3633],
